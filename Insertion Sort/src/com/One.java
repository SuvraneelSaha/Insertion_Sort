        1] Insertion sort acts in steps

        2] it sorts the arr in steps ex

        - 5 3 4 2 1
        it will first sort upto index 1
        like
        3 5 4 2 1
        then it will sort upto index 2
        3 4 5 2 1
        then it will sort upto index 3
        2 3 4 5 1
        then it will sort upto index 4
        1 2 3 4 5
        done

        3] time complexity
        best case - O(n-1) ie O(N)
        worst case - O(N^2)

        4] It is a stable sorting algorithm

        5] It is also used in case of hybrid sorting algorithm

        6] it is good with small range with numbers as its best case time complexity is O(N)

        7] it works good with partial sorted array
